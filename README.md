Meta-DAO Smart Contract

Overview

The Meta-DAO Smart Contract is a DAO of DAOs built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity.
It provides a governance framework where multiple sub-DAOs can exist under one Meta-DAO umbrella, enabling structured collaboration, governance, and proposal-based decision-making across different decentralized organizations.

This contract manages:

Meta-DAO membership

Sub-DAO creation and membership

Governance proposals & voting

Delegated powers and voting weights

✨ Features
🏛 Meta-DAO Membership

Anyone can join the Meta-DAO.

Members gain voting power (default: 1).

Membership includes activation/deactivation status checks.

🌐 Sub-DAOs

Members can create new sub-DAOs.

Each sub-DAO has a name, description, creator, creation block, and active status.

Sub-DAO creators are automatically added as admins.

Members can join sub-DAOs and receive roles (creator, member).

Sub-DAOs track their own member count.

📜 Governance Proposals

Any Meta-DAO member can create a proposal with:

title, description, proposal-type, target-dao-id (optional)

voting-period (defined in blocks)

Voting is based on member voting power.

Votes are recorded as yes/no and cannot be changed once cast.

Proposals can expire when their voting period ends.

✅ Voting

Only active Meta-DAO members can vote.

Members vote once per proposal.

Voting results are tracked (yes-votes, no-votes).

🔒 Governance Controls

Meta-DAO governance can deactivate sub-DAOs.

Voting enforces fair, weighted decision-making.

📂 Contract Structure

Constants → Error codes & ownership

Data variables → next-dao-id, next-proposal-id

Maps:

sub-daos → stores all sub-DAO details

meta-members → tracks Meta-DAO membership

dao-members → tracks sub-DAO memberships

proposals → governance proposals

proposal-votes → proposal votes

⚙️ Public Functions

🚀 Deployment Notes

Deploy using Clarinet or the Stacks CLI.

Ensure the contract owner is set correctly (defaults to tx-sender on deploy).

Carefully manage governance proposals for safe sub-DAO deactivation.

📌 Example Flow

A user joins the Meta-DAO → gains membership.

The user creates a sub-DAO → becomes its creator/admin.

Other members join the sub-DAO → membership grows.

A proposal is created → defines governance action.

Members vote → proposal passes or fails.

Governance decision can deactivate or modify sub-DAOs.

✅ Use Cases

Umbrella DAO governance: Manage many smaller DAOs under one structure.

Cross-DAO collaboration: Proposals that impact multiple sub-DAOs.

DAO federation: Decentralized organizations uniting under one governance layer.
